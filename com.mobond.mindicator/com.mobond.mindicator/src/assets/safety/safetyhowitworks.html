<h2>Women Safety Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Avoid all travels at night. Never get into a cab or auto that already occupied with any male passenger.</li>
<li>Your eye contact with stranges should be brief and never intimating.</li>
<li>Act confident and try not making enquiries from strangers.</li>
<li>Keep some speed-dial numbers and some self-defence devices handy.</li>

<li>If the ladies compartment is empty, board the general one instead. It is always better to be in the company of a group of people (men or women) rather than none at all.</li>
<li>Carry a pen knife or pepper spray for self-defense. A torch is handy if the lights go off.</li>
<li>If travelling late, try and board the compartment very next to the driver’s coach.</li>
<li>Avoid late night travelling to suburbs when you are alone. If you have to, take someone along.</li>
<li>Don’t stand or hang near the door. If the train is over-crowded, skip it and take the next one.</li>
<li>Wearing expensive jewellery in the train is a big NO. Keep them in your handbag if you have to.</li>
<li>Be extremely watchful about the people who board the train. If you notice anyone suspicious, try and attract the attention of someone on the platform.</li>
<li>Don’t ignore, Raise your Voice calmly, firmly, and without insults or personal attacks to let them know that their actions are unwelcome, unacceptable, and wrong.</li>
<li>Do not go into arguments/shouting- what are you doing? Or why you’re doing this to me, instead, ‘Name the Act’ ex: ‘You (He) pinched me’. ‘Why are you staring at me this way?’.</li>
<li>Scream, be confident and be loud enough when you confront the harasser.</li>
<li>Don’t hesitate to take help of bystanders.</li>
<li>Call Mumbai Police: <a href="tel:103">103</a></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2>Role of Bystanders</h2>
<ol>
<li>As a bystander, try to intervene in the matter where women might require help. In such situation yell, scream and draw more public attention.</li>
<li>If you come across any situation of violence on women, engage the victim in some way that will distract from harasser. Ex: ‘Can you tell me the time?’ ‘I need to go there, which train I must take?’ .</li>
<li>Call on Helpline numbers and report about the harassment that you witnessed.</li>
